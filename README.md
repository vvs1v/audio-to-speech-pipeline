# Intelligent Data Pipeline # Writing this line to trigger the pipeline 
### It is a part of [Vakyansh's](https://open-speech-ekstep.github.io) recipes to build state of the art Speech Recogniition Model

Pipelines to transform raw data and prepare data for model training. They clean, process and balance data for model training

## Key Highlights

- **Automated**: Vakyansh's pipelines are fully automated and no human intervention is required to process 
  the audio pipelines. It uses pre trained models to identify language, gender and speakers in the audio.
- **Scalable**: Process thousands of hours of data in 2-3 days leveraging K8s capabilities. Allows faster time to market.
- **Versatile**: Vakyansh's pipelines can run on any VM's or Kubernetes cluster on any cloud. 
  For scalability it is recommended to run on Kubernetes
- **Quality**: Vakyansh lays strong emphasis on code quality and high test
  coverage to ensure its seamless use and continued maintenance.
